Divock Origi, who scored decisive goals in the semi-final and final for Liverpool last season, dragged a shot off target, while his low, skipping drive was pushed away by 21-year-old goalkeeper Gaetan Coucke at full stretch.
After Oxlade-Chamberlain had made it 2-1, Genk could have equalised for a second time late on, but Bryan Heynen's thumping effort was pushed away by Alisson, extending their run without a victory in the Champions League proper to 16 games - a competition record.
Of the six players brought into the starting line-up here, Oxlade-Chamberlain was on the scoresheet once more, Naby Keita worked hard in midfield beside him and Joe Gomez contributed four clearances and three interceptions at the back.

Costa caused problems when he raced though on goal only to have his shot saved by Adrian, but West Ham struggled to clear the danger and Cesar Azpilicueta was brought to ground by Michail Antonio as he burst into the area.The Wales international’s initial header from Dimitri Payet’s corner fell to Enner Valencia, whose effort was blocked, but Collins reacted first to the rebound to fire through a crowded area for his fourth career goal against Chelsea.

Mikel Arteta's side broke the deadlock on 54 minutes through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's well-placed header and Pepe doubled the lead just three minutes later with a neat, first-time finish.
Mesut Ozil poked in a third late on from substitute Alexandre Lacazette's pass and the Frenchman converted a fourth in injury-time.
Newcastle attempted to play further forward after conceding but were restricted to few opportunities - the dangerous Allan Saint-Maximin coming closest with a curling strike that rattled the post.
Bukayo Saka curled narrowly wide, Pepe had a free-kick tipped over by Martin Dubravka and Shkodran Mustafi saw his hooked shot headed off the line by Joelinton.
But Arsenal came out with renewed focus in the second half and scored twice before the hour mark to put the game to bed - Aubameyang powering in a header for his 15th league goal of the campaign from Pepe's hanging cross.
The appointment of Steve Bruce as Newcastle boss to replace the popular Rafael Benitez was not universally well-received by supporters but the ex-Manchester United defender has responded to critics with a decent debut campaign.

Raul Jimenez was chief culprit for the hosts, heading three excellent opportunities either over or wide of the Leicester goal and slashing woefully at a left-foot shot that drifted wide of Kasper Schmeichel's and remained in play.
When Wolves did hit the target, Schmeichel was there to deny them, brilliantly stretching out his left leg to prevent Diogo Jota from scoring and blocking Adama Traore's stinging stoppage-time shot at point-blank range. 
And the 33-year-old's evening did not get any better as he failed to register a single shot, meaning he has now gone six Premier League games without a goal - his longest run without a top-flight goal since he went seven games between December 2016 and February 2017.

Chelsea, with Lampard making a first-half tactical switch when he introduced Jorginho for the struggling Emerson, were gifted an equaliser seven minutes from time when goalkeeper Bernd Leno hopelessly misjudged Mason Mount's free-kick to leave the substitute with a simple finish.
Arsenal were doubly frustrated because Jorginho was fortunate to escape a second yellow card earlier for a cynical foul on Lucas Torreira - but Arteta's home bow was to get even more painful.
Chelsea struck again with three minutes of normal time left, Tammy Abraham turning Arsenal substitute Shkodran Mustafi far too easily in the area to beat Leno and complete the smash-and-grab raid.
Arsenal, who lost defender Calum Chambers to injury in the first half, will start 2020 11 points behind fourth-placed Chelsea and without a Premier League home win since 6 October.
Arteta understandably looked downcast as he and his players took sympathetic applause from their fans after they were left stunned by Chelsea's late surge.
The Gunners, however, ran out of steam towards the end of the first half as Chelsea, helped by Lampard removing Emerson and sending on Jorginho, started to dominate and continued to do so after the break.

Burnley's only opportunity during the first half was an optimistic long-range effort from Dwight McNeil that was pushed away by Martin Dubravka.
Jack Cork should have sealed the win when he robbed Sean Longstaff of the ball inside the Newcastle half and evaded Fernandez on the edge of the area, but his low shot was well blocked by Dubravka.
Hitting the ball towards lone striker Andy Carroll was an obvious tactic, with Newcastle attempting 20 crosses from open play.

Bournemouth's ventures into Chelsea's half were few and far betweenbut when they did cross the halfway line, their hosts looked far from comfortable with Joshua King enjoying several forays forward.

But Chelsea were left shellshocked after Gosling's goal - one of only two shots on target the Cherries had.
With his back to goal, Gosling perfectly flicked the ball over and in, with the Bournemouth end of Stamford Bridge erupting as VAR made its decision.
Lampard brought in Antonio Rudiger to face Bournemouth for only his second league appearance this season and the Germany international shone in the Blues' defence, making more clearances and winning more possession than any of his team-mates.

he helped fire to promotion last season, while Willian - one of Chelsea's other star performers - hit the post with an exquisite free-kick.
It was a richly deserved lead for the home side with Villa rarely having ventured into the Chelsea box, but it was greeted with muted celebrations from the striker, who scored 25 league goals in 38 Championship matches for Villa in his season-long loan. 
After showing exceptional awareness and composure to tee up Mount's winner, he was unfortunate not to score another himself - clipping wide of the left-hand post and being hustled out of a close-range chance by Mings - before departing to a standing ovation with seven minutes left.
A quick-thinking pass from skipper Jack Grealish, who Smith complained afterwards needs more protection from referees, was key in the attack which led to Villa's equaliser, allowing Ahmed Elmohamady to cross to Trezeguet who bundled in at the second attempt.
Other than that, Villa rarely threatened as they managed just three shots on target in the whole match, although Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was required to deny Douglas Luiz what would have been an undeserved equaliser late on.

Deeney and Deulofeu both went close as Bournemouth became increasingly ragged, with Pereyra wrapping up a fine win with virtually the last kick of the game after Andre Gray's shot had been cleared off the line by Ryan Fraser.
Their best chance of the first half came from a set-piece, with Harry Wilson's curling free-kick well pushed away by Ben Foster.

The Blues could have had more but three was plenty against a Clarets side who rarely threatened, coming closest to a goal through a Ben Mee header that Ross Barkley hacked off the line.
Despite adding the inventive Ross Barkley to a midfield three already containing Mason Mount they lacked the incisiveness and crispness of passing required to open up a well-drilled Clarets.

Hudson-Odoi made sure of that with his neat finish almost immediately after the break, allowing Chelsea to cruise.
There are mitigating circumstances, with manager Sean Dyche largely reliant on one consistent attacking threat in Chris Wood, because of injuries to Ashley Barnes and Jay Rodriguez.
Dyche's attempted solution to his side's current dire run and a return of just five goals from nine games was to play Jeff Hendrick behind Wood as part of a five-man midfield.

On Friday, Pochettino said he has no doubt over the commitment of his players, particularly those in the final year of their contract such as Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, the latter pair retaining their places despite shortcomings being ruthlessly exposed in midweek.
There was no questioning Vertonghen's desire to put his body on the line, blocking Dale Stephens' goalbound volley with his head before needing treatment after a clash of heads with Maupay. 
His tame long-range strike was Tottenham's only shot on target in the first half, and although Spurs won three corners in quick succession at the start of the second half, they still couldn't muster an effort on goal.
Later on, the ball squirmed away from Son Heung-min in the box while Harry Kane fired over, before substitute Lucas Moura was twice denied by Mat Ryan as Spurs failed even to claim a consolation, seemingly leaving Pochettino and Spurs at a crossroads.
But moments later, Connolly got in front of Ben Davies to flick Dan Burn's cross goalwards and slam in the rebound, before side-footing wide from Pascal Gross' squared ball.
The Seagulls remained comfortable for most of the second half, with Gross going for goal from a tight angle and curling a free-kick against the crossbar, before Lewis Dunk released Connolly down the left for his second goal.
Brighton played well.
